# Facial composite with ML

Replicating an application that makes a “Facial composite”, by reconstructing the visualization of a suspects face with the memory of a eyewitness, by using “Mr. Potato Head”-method to randomly generate different types of faces and the “generic algorithm” in machine learning, to optimize the visual representation.
